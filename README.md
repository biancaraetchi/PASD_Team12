# Backend Development Technologies
## C# with ASP.NET
### Used libraries:
System.Net: This library provides a simple programming interface for many of the protocols used on networks today. It allows you to use classes such as HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.

System: This is the core library for the C# language and provides a wide range of functionality, including basic data types and support for many common programming patterns such as events and asynchronous programming.

System.Collections.Generic: This library provides a set of generic collection classes that allow you to create strongly typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic collections.

System.Linq: This library provides a set of query operators that allow you to perform complex data queries and transformations using a syntax that is similar to SQL.

System.Net.Http: This library provides a set of classes for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses using the modern HttpClient class.

System.Text: This library provides classes for working with text, including the Encoding class which is used to convert between different character encodings.

Newtonsoft.Json: This library provides classes for working with JSON, including the JsonConvert class which is used to convert between JSON and .NET objects.

System.Net.Http.Headers: This library provides classes for working with HTTP headers, including the MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue and HttpResponseHeaders classes.

System.Threading.Tasks: This library provides a set of classes for working with tasks, including the Task class which is used to perform asynchronous operations.

## Running The Project

The backend part of the project can be run by going through 2 steps.

---
### Step 1 - Installing the Prerequisites
.Net 7.0 SDK: instructions on installing can be found on https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0

NewtonSoft.Json:  open a powershell in the backend project folder before running the command:

    	dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.2


---
### Step 2 - Running the script

Following that, we run the following command:

    dotnet run
